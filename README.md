# Real-Time Auction Project
- This project is developed using a microservices architecture to create a real-time auction platform. Here are the key features of the project:

## Technologies: Spring Boot, React.js, MySQL8, and other relevant technologies.
## Real-Time Updates: Socket.io is used for real-time communication between clients and the server.
## Authentication and Authorization: Users can register, log in, and participate in auctions. Tokens are used for secure authentication.
## Item Listings: Users can view available items, their descriptions, and current bids.
## Bidding: Users can place bids on items, and the highest bid is `updated` in real time.
## Admin Panel: An admin panel allows managing items and auctions.
